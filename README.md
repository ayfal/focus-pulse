# FocusPulse
This is a very simple and surprisingly effective productivity tool:

It just alerts you every few minutes to switch tasks, so you get a new burst of focus on a different task. Also if you get distracted, it will remind you to get back on track.

There are 3 versions of this tool:

1. A simple browser version that you can open in your browser locally and is also available online at https://ayfal.github.io/focus-pulse/Browser%20version/FocusPulse.html. It supports a small semicolon separated tasklist.

2. A tiny app version that you can run on your computer (you need to have python installed). It supports a small comma separated tasklist. 

3. A document version (you need to have Microsoft Word installed). This is for managing your calendar, your timetable and your tasklist all in one place. I personally use this every day all day, and have set up windows to open this document on startup, so it is always there when I start working.
